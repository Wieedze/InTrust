/**
 * The `node:dns` module enables name resolution. For example, use it to look up IP
 * addresses of host names.
 *
 * Although named for the [Domain Name System (DNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System), it does not always use the
 * DNS protocol for lookups. {@link lookup} uses the operating system
 * facilities to perform name resolution. It may not need to perform any network
 * communication. To perform name resolution the way other applications on the same
 * system do, use {@link lookup}.
 *
 * ```js
 * import dns from 'node:dns';
 *
 * dns.lookup('example.org', (err, address, family) => {
 *   console.log('address: %j family: IPv%s', address, family);
 * });
 * // address: "9
