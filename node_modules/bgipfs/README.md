```

### Configuration

During cluster setup, the `cluster config` command will help you populate:

#### Environment Variables (.env)
- `PEERNAME` - Peer name in the IPFS Cluster
- `SECRET` - Cluster secret
- `PEERADDRESSES` - Bootstrap peer addresses
- `ADMIN_USERNAME` - Admin username for dashboard access
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Admin password for dashboard access
- `USER_USERNAME` - User username for upload endpoint
- `USER_PASSWORD` - User password for upload endpoint
- `GATEWAY_DOMAIN` - Gateway domain (dns mode)
- `UPLOAD_DOMAIN` - Upload endpoint domain (dns mode)

#### Configuration Files
- `identity.json` - Cluster peer identity [DO NOT SHARE]
- `service.json` - Cluster service configuration
- `ipfs.config.json` - IPFS node configuration
- `auth/admin-htpasswd` - Admin credentials for dashboard access
- `auth/user-htpasswd` - User credentials for upload endpoint

#### Backup
The `cluster backup` command creates a complete backup of your IPFS cluster, including:
- IPFS node data
- IPFS Cluster data
- All configuration files
- Authentication files

Usage:
```bash
# Create backup with automatic timestamped directory
bgipfs cluster backup

# Create backup in a specific directory
bgipfs cluster backup --output ./my-backup
```

### Updating

The `cluster update` command helps you update IPFS and IPFS Cluster to their latest versions:

```bash
# Update with automatic backup
bgipfs cluster update

# Update without backup
bgipfs cluster update --no-backup

# Update with backup to specific directory
bgipfs cluster update --backup-dir ./my-backup
```

The update process:
1. Creates a backup of all data and configuration (unless --no-backup is specified)
2. Stops the running services
3. Pulls the latest Docker images
4. Starts the services with the new versions
5. Verifies all services are running correctly

### IPFS Peering

To enable peering between IPFS nodes in your cluster:

1. **Announce Your Node**
   ```bash
   # Configure with interactive prompt
   bgipfs cluster ipfs-announce

   # Configure with specific domain
   bgipfs cluster ipfs-announce --domain example.com
   ```
   This will:
   - Configure IPFS to listen on all interfaces
   - Announce your public domain for peering
   - Clear any no-announce filters
   - Restart IPFS to apply changes
   - Display your Peer ID

2. **Connect to Another Node**
   ```bash
   # Connect with interactive prompts
   bgipfs cluster ipfs-peer

   # Connect with specific details
   bgipfs cluster ipfs-peer --domain example.com --peer-id QmPeerId
   ```
   This will:
   - Connect to the specified IPFS node
   - Verify the connection was successful
   - Display all connected peers

The domain will be saved in your `.env` file as `IPFS_PEERING_DOMAIN`.

## Upload Commands
Powered by [ipfs-uploader](../ipfs-uploader/)
```bash
bgipfs upload config init  # Initialize upload configuration
bgipfs upload config get   # Get upload configuration
bgipfs upload [PATH]      # Upload a file, directory, or URL to IPFS
```

### Examples
```bash
# Upload a file
bgipfs upload path/to/file.txt

# Upload a directory
bgipfs upload path/to/directory

# Upload from URL
bgipfs upload https://example.com/image.jpg

# Upload with custom config
bgipfs upload --config ./custom/path/config.json path/to/file.txt
```

## Sync Commands
This is for manually syncing pin lists between nodes. The specified nodes can be Kubo endpoints, or the IPFS proxy endpoint of an IPFS Cluster node. This is powered by [js-kubo-rpc-client](https://github.com/ipfs/js-kubo-rpc-client)

```bash
bgipfs sync config init  # Initialize sync configuration
bgipfs sync config get   # Get sync configuration
bgipfs sync [ls|add|pin] # Sync pins between IPFS nodes - ls just lists, pin lists and pins, add fetches, adds and pins
```

### Examples
```bash
# List pins from origin node
bgipfs sync ls

# List pins with a limit
bgipfs sync ls --limit 10

# Pin CIDs from origin to destination
bgipfs sync pin

# Pin with a limit
bgipfs sync pin --limit 5

# Add and pin content from origin to destination
bgipfs sync add

# Add with status tracking and resume capability
bgipfs sync add --statusFile sync-status.csv

# Retry failed pins from previous run
bgipfs sync add --statusFile sync-status.csv --retry

# Customize parallel processing and progress updates
bgipfs sync add --chunkSize 20 --progressUpdate 50

# Set error thresholds for automatic stopping
bgipfs sync add --errorThreshold 25 --errorWindow 50
```

### Options
- `--statusFile`: File to track sync status. If exists, will resume from last state
- `--retry`: Retry failed pins from status file
- `--limit`: Limit the number of pins to process (useful for testing)
- `--chunkSize`: Number of pins to process in parallel (default: 10)
- `--progressUpdate`: Number of pins to process before showing progress (default: 100)
- `--errorThreshold`: Stop if rolling error rate exceeds this percentage (0-100, default: 50)
- `--errorWindow`: Number of pins to consider for rolling error rate (default: 100)
- `--pinSource`: Source of pins: "origin" or path to CSV file (default: "origin")
